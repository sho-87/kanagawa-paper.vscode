This is a Visual Studio Code port of the [Kanagawa Paper](https://github.com/sho-87/kanagawa-paper.nvim) neovim theme. More details, and extra themes for other applications, can be found in that repo.

In addition to the `Paper` theme, this extension also includes the original `Wave` theme. Credit to the original author [here](https://github.com/barklan/kanagawa.vscode).

Compared to the `Wave` theme, `Paper` uses a more muted color palette fo syntax highlighting, which is a bit easier on the eyes.
